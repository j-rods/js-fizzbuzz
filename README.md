# FizzBuzz JavaScript

Test Driven Development (TDD) and Pair Programming challenge with Jasmine and Javascript

##How it works:

The program is passed a number.
When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message "fizz".
When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message "buzz".
When passed a number that is a multiple of 3 and 5, the program returns the message "fizzbuzz".
When the number is neither of the above, the number is returned.

## How to Run

Open file in browser.
On the console, type:

```
for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(fizzBuzz.says(i));
}
```
